# JS Roll The Dice game

This game is a part of Udemy course coding challanges, created to test the skills.

The expected behaviour:
User 1 clicks 'Roll dice' and gets a random number, the can choose to 'Hold' it to save the score or keep clicking to make it bigger, but if the random number is 1, the game resets to the next user and the previously added scores are deleted.

User 2 begins the game if 'Hold' is clicked or User 1 gets '1' as the result. 

The winner is the player that reaches '100' score the fastest. When clicking 'New game' the game resets.
